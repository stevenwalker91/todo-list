# todo-list

## Summary

This is the first major project in a while and compromises some both functional and UI challenges. With some recent projects I've chosen to focus primarily on the project outcome i.e. minimal UI work on programming projects, however with this I'll be aiming to do complete UI and functionality.

[Demo](https://todo-list.steven-walker.co.uk/)

## Outcomes

Some of the key things to achieve in this project:

* Seamless & responsive UI
* Dynamically generated HTML for single page approach
* Object oriented approach achieving single responsibility principle
* Utilising webpack to keep code modularised and contained
* Interaction with local storage to save data on the user device

## Features & Functionality

- [x] A user can create a task
- [x] A user can assign a due date, priority, notes to a task
- [ ] A user can create a project, or collection of tasks
- [x] A user can assign a task to a project
- [x] A user can edit or delete a task
- [x] A user can see their upcoming or expired tasks
- [x] A user can have previously submitted tasks loaded from local storage


### Optional Features

- [ ] Text recognition on a task to automatically assign a due date e.g. _Send email **tomorrow**_
- [ ] Drag and drop tasks between differen groups
  


## Sequence

1. Design out the UI
2. Model how objects & modules will be seperated with single responsibility principle
3. Build out core HTML and headers that will remain static
4. Build out HTML that will dynamically be generated and pushed onto page e.g. projects vs Tasks
5. Implement functions for application logic
6. Implement UI functions for updating the display
7. Implement event listeners
8. Orchestrate logic and UI updates when events are triggered
